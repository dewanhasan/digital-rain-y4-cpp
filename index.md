## **Digital Rain C++ Project**

This project aims to recreate the Matrix-style digital rain effect in a modern C++ console application. Using object-oriented programming (OOP), we structure the simulation into modular components: DigitalRain controls the animation, while RainDrop manages individual falling elements. The simulation features smooth animations, randomized movement, and scalable design, utilizing multi-threading and efficient console rendering. This documentation provides insights into the implementation, functionality, and potential improvements.


### **Log 1: First Attempt**

In my initial In my initial attempt at the Digital Rain simulation, I created a simple C++ program that randomly placed the word "Hello" at different positions in the console. The implementation used GotoXY() to move the cursor and rand() to generate random coordinates within the console's width and height. However, instead of cascading rain-like movement, the words appeared randomly and stacked up, creating a scattered effect rather than a falling animation. This provided a useful starting point for understanding console manipulation and random positioning, but the next step is to implement a continuous downward motion to better simulate the rain effect.In my initial attempt at the Digital Rain simulation, I created a simple C++ program that randomly placed the word "Hello" at different positions in the console.
