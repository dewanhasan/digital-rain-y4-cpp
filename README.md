## **Digital Rain Project**

This project simulates a Matrix-style digital rain effect in the console using modern C++. It features animated falling characters, user-selectable themes (Multicolor, Matrix Green, Binary), and interactive keyboard controls (like ESC to return to the menu). The code is written with a focus on clarity, modular design, and interactive visual output.

**How to Run the Project:**

Upon launching the program, the user is presented with a menu to choose from three visual themes.
